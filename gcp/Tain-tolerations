Concepts
You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

### https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/ 


kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
places a taint on node node1. The taint has key key1, value value1, and taint effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.

To remove the taint added by the command above, you can run:

kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-
You specify a toleration for a pod in the PodSpec. Both of the following tolerations "match" the taint created by the kubectl taint line above, and thus a pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto node1:

tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
Here's an example of a pod that uses tolerations:

pods/pod-with-toleration.yaml Copy pods/pod-with-toleration.yaml to clipboard
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "example-key"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
